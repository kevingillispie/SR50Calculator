NOTE: This is a project in developement. It is **not** yet fully functional.
## Introduction
> The SR-50 was Texas Instruments' first scientific pocket calculator with trigonometric and logarithm functions. It enhanced their earlier SR-10 and SR-11 calculators, introduced in 1973, which had featured scientific notation, squares, square root, and reciprocals, but had no trig or log functions, and lacked other features. The SR-50 was introduced in 1974 and sold for US$170. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_SR-50))

This project will attempt to emulate the functionality and behavior of this classic calculator.

## UPDATES
__20210720__ I've discovered the original SR-50 manual. It includes all the details about how the calculator operates that I could not extrapolate from the button labels themselves. Most importantly, it includes an explanation of how the onboard registers store data for algebraic calculations. Major rewrite of the codebase is commencing.
